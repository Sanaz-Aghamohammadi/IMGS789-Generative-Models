# IMGS789-Generative-Models
# Deep Generative Models: GANs and VAEs

This repository contains the implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for generating and reconstructing images from the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. It explores the capabilities of these models in deep generative tasks, such as image generation, anomaly detection, and latent space analysis.

## Overview

The project is divided into two main sections:
1. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Implementation and analysis of simple GANs and Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) for image generation.
2. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** Implementation of VAEs for tasks like image reconstruction, anomaly detection, and latent space visualization.

Each model's performance is evaluated through various metrics and visualizations, providing insights into the learning dynamics and effectiveness of these generative techniques.
